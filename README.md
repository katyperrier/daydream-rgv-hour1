—Game during Hack Club's Daydream——
WIP

In hour1, you play as a happy, agile little clay-person
Your clay person moves with the standard A and D, or arrow keys; and jumps with spacebar

But your clay person also comes with abilities
Pressing Y will swing you upwards, 'shift' will dash you forwards, and a double-tap of spacebar will double jump

Upon reaching the sacrificial portal, however, your clay-person will be weakened, lose a power, and be forced to traverse the terrain again
